            <h2>Pre-construction</h2>
             <img src="ivory/image 2.jpg" alt="image 2" class="center">
            <p>
                Contractor involvement and participation during the early stages of design reduces 
                risk and facilitates a well-coordinated and expedited construction stage.
                 During the pre-construction period Ivory Steel Contractors Uganda Ltd can have active input into the technical 
                 issues implicated by the project design and help assess its actual build-ability. 
                 We will highlight possible site issues, Building requirements 
             and logistic considerations.
                  We will call upon our years of collective practical experience to develop preliminary 
                  staging plans and a project specific approach.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Our estimating team will prepare a preliminary baseline budget which will become the client’s first visibility into the cost of making a vision become reality. 
                 From initial test fits through schematic design, then detailed design and final construction documents, Ivory Steel Contractors Ug Ltd will provide full budget services at each stage of the process.
                 From inception to completion.

            <h2>Construction management</h2>
            <img src="ivory/image 3.jpg" alt="image 3" class="center">
            <p>
                As projects become more complex and schedules become more aggressive, Construction Management arrangements have become more common.
                In this approach, the Client and Construction Manager agree on a fee structure for the Construction Manager’s costs and fee.
                 This can be established based upon fixed numbers or based upon percentages of the cost of the Subcontractor/Vendor costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Construction Management arrangements provide less initial cost certainty,
                 but the Construction Manager acts as the client’s agent and solely in the best
                  interests of the client and project from the outset.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contractually, Ivory Steel Contractors Ug Ltd will manage and coordinate all trades from start to finish.
                 We will hold each individual contract (same as general contracting),
                  but the client/design team will have full visibility into all sub-contractor and vendor costs through the bidding,
                   buy out and award processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ivory Steel Contractors Ug Ltd will competitively bid all aspects of the project,
                 which ensures that we are achieving the most cost effective and responsible price for each trade.

            </p>
            <p>
                This approach gives significantly more visibility into all project costs and offers the possibility of a shared returned savings to the Client for any costs that come in under the project budget.
            </p>

            <h2>General constructing</h2>
            <img src="ivory/image 4.jpg" alt="image 4" class="center">
            <p>
                The traditional project delivery method for many construction projects is through
                 a General Contracting approach which is executed through a Stipulated Sum Contract. 
                 This can also be known as a Lump Sum Contract.

            </p>The contract value is established as a Total or“Lump Sum” price, broken down by
             each trade for the full construction works.This sum is based on a fully developed set
              of construction drawings and specifications.As the main contractor,Ivory Steel Contractors Ug Ltd then becomes
               responsible for all scope outlined in these construction documents.</p>
            <p>While there is more initial cost certainty and a reduced initial financial risk for
                 the client, the responsibility will fall onto the design team to have a fully
                  developed and coordinated set of bid documents, as any scope that falls outside
                   of those documents is subject to becoming an extra cost to the Client.
                    Extra costs typically come through via a Change Order to the base contract value.
            </p>
            <p> This approach works best when the project design schedule allows for 
                an adequate period of time for the architects,engineers and other consultants
                 to survey the site, investigate material selections, fully design the project
                  and then coordinate their drawings with each other. This way you then hand the
                   main contractor a fully coordinated set of drawings and further reducing the 
                   project risks, whilst increasing cost certainty.</p>

            <h2>Design and build</h2>
            <img src="ivory/image 1.jpg" alt="image 1" class="center">
            
               <p>The main client advantage of the Design &Build approach is that
                 it puts the full risk of the entire process on the Design & Build
                  entity.</p>
                
                <p>For Design & Build to be fully successful it is critical to engage
                     ISC Uganda as early in the process as possible,preferably at
                      or before site selection. ISC will work to fully understand
                       your intentions and expectations, and will then form the
                        Project Team under the ISC umbrella. We have many strategic
                         partners in all aspects of the industry 
                         (Architects, Engineers, Consultants, Specialists, etc) 
                         and will quickly utilize these to offer you the best team
                          possible.</p>
                
                <p>ISC will hold direct contracts with each members of the project 
                    team, as well as the individual sub-contractors and vendors.
                    This means that ISC becomes your "one stop shop" for everything
                     to do with the project, and the only entity the client needs to
                      deal with.</p>
                
                <p>This approach transfers the risk of the project onto ISC. 
                    Once designs have been developed (typically the layout or
                     schematic design stage), we will provide a Not to Exceed price
                      for all works (both design and construction) typically under a 
                      Guaranteed Maximum Price Contract, also known as a GMP.
                       This GMP will stay firm unless the client adds or removes
                        scope, dramatically changes the design intentions or if there
                         are unknown site conditions or circumstances.</p>
                
                <p>One of the biggest benefits to taking the D&B approach is that you
                     can expedite the project by stacking and releasing certain
                      design packages, whilst the full design is still being
                       completed. This also helps absorb any long lead items so
                        that they don't delay or impact the main construction
                         schedule.</p>
                
                <p>Another benefit to this delivery method is the overall project is 
                    harmony. As one entity holds all contracts, rather than each team
                     having their own contract with the client, there is a much more 
                     collaborative and single team approach. Having everyone working
                      with the same entity removes any "barriers" between the
                       companies and creates a more organic flow between the design 
                       teams and the construction teams. This allows for better
                        coordination and expedited resolution to site issues.</p>
